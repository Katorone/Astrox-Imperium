# This file contains configuration settings for:
# - shipfiles_2_csv.py
# - csv_2_shipfiles.py

# For complex setups it's now possible to include these scripts in a toolchain.
# Both py scripts will accept the argument --config /path/to/custom_config.py
#   Example: python3 ~/Projects/Astrox/shipfiles_2_csv.py --config ~/Projects/AstroxModPack/modpacksettings.py
# The benefit here is that only a copy of this file needs to be adjusted while
# the actual scripts can be easily updated.

# Please read through this file and adjust the values where needed.

# Initializing variables containing settings, please don't change the following lines:
shipdata = {}
keys = {}
delimiter = {}

### PATHS
## Note: Example for windows users:
##       C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\Astrox Imperium\Astrox Imperium_Data\MOD\ships
## These paths are completely configurable to help with toolchaining and automation.
## See the note on top about calling shipdata_2_csv.py and csv_2_shipdata.py with the config argument.
##
# Path to the Astrox Imperium ship files you want to create a csv FROM
shipdata['source'] = "~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Astrox Imperium/Astrox Imperium_Data/MOD/ships"
# Path to the Astrox Imperium ship files you want to export a csv TO
# IMPORTANT: Any directory can be used as a destination, but this directory needs to have a copy
#            of Astrox ship files!

# When True, this settings adds: 'All done. Press enter to exit.' after the scripts run
# Enable this if you want to see the scripts' output when running them from the file browser

# When writing 'SHIP_specials_raw' to the csv, expand them to be human readable?
# This setting makes it easier to edit SHIP_specials_raw
# Examples
#   False : Thrust#0.20,Miner Range#0.60,Miner Energy#0.50
#   True : Thrust: 0.20
#          Miner Range: 0.60
#          Miner Energy: 0.50
# NOTE: csv_2_shipdata.py will always try to rebuild the original string for Astrox,

### CSV OPTIONS
## When creating the csv from shipdata, the script will always encapsulate the fields with quotation marks
## Both Excel and LibreOffice Calc should have no issues reading these files.
## Because of a wide range of system and language settings, it is possible to config
## the delimiter here, for both reading a csv and writing to a csv.
##
## NOTE: Excel users might want to set these to "|", per https://github.com/Katorone/Astrox-Imperium/blob/main/README.md
# For best compatibility, do not set this to any of these characters: #.,:
# Delimiter to use when creating a csv FROM shipfiles
delimiter['write_csv'] = ";"
# Delimiter to use when writing shipfiles FROM a csv
delimiter['read_csv'] = ";"
