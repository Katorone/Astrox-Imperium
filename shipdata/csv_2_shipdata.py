# This script imports ship data from a csv-file to the Astrox MOD/ships directory.
# It will rewrite the <STATS> section as follows:
#  - First pass: Insert the keys and values from the csv in the order defined by "keys'.
#  - Second pass: Delete all duplicate keys below the inserted ones
# Any key that isn't in the csv will be safe and end up at the bottom of the <STATS>-section
# All other sections will be kept as they were.
